# STUDYBUDDY AI

StudyBuddy AI is a student-focused exam preparation project built to make studying from large PDFs more effective using AI.

Students upload PDFs, and the system uses a RAG approach to generate summaries, important questions, MCQs, and viva-style questions from the content.

Students can ask doubts based on the uploaded PDF, and the AI answers using relevant content from the notes.

The AI acts like an examiner by conducting mock quizzes or viva sessions and providing marks and feedback to help students improve.

This project was built to apply AI concepts to a real problem faced by students during exam preparation.
